This course is excellent for students who want to improve their grades drastically. With full effort from both the sides, A* seemed like an easy goal.",

      "Even though a tutor typically just focuses on the syllabus content, my teacher here at e2a was an enthusiast for cybersecurity and  programming, who not only taught us the course contents but also sparked an interest for vast possibilities in the realm of computer science. Due to his knowledge and experience, he was able to share and simplify all the topics of CS(9618) which made them easy to understand. Also the company I was exposed to in e2a has been one of the most welcoming environment I had ever encountered.",
